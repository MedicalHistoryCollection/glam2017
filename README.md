# Swiss Open Cultural Data Hackathon 2017: Medical History Collection

Data and code relating to the Medical History Collection project for #GLAMHack2017.

Our data comes from the University Institute for History of Medicine and Public Health of the [CHUV](http://www.chuv.ch/).
We have the metadata of the entire book collection, and photographs + metadata of a section of the object collection.
We aim to find connections and pathways between the two collections.
